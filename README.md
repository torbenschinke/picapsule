# picapsule

picapsule is a heritage time capsule which consists of a hardware part and a software part.
The hardware is based on a Raspberry Pi 4 or better and a Nago Web Application which is displayed on a Raspberry Touchdisplay 2 within a webbrowser in kiosk mode as UI.
Because it does not need any batteries or internet it has the potential to last decades and must only plugged with power and call it a day.
